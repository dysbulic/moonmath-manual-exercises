## *Exercise 3.2.2.5*: (Integer Long Division).

Find an $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ and an $r \in \mathbb{N}$ with $0 \leq r < |b|$ such that $a = m · b + r$ holds for the following pairs:

* $(a,b) = (27, 5)$
* $(a,b) = (27, −5)$
* $(a,b) = (127, 0)$
* $(a,b) = (−1687, 11)$
* $(a,b) = (0, 7)$

In which cases are your solutions unique?
