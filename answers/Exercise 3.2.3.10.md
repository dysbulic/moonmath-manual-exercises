## *Exercise 3.2.3.10:*

Find all numbers $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $0 ≤ k ≤ 100$ such that $gcd(100, k) = 5$.

---
---

$100 = 5^2·2^2$ so the non-prime factors of $100$ are $10, 20, 25, 50$.

Approach: 

  Start with the set of all multiples of $5$ less greater than zero and less than $100$.

  Remove all multiples of $10$ and $25$, in the process also removing multiples of $20$ and $50$.

Multiples of $10$:

  $10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100$

Multiples of $25$:

  $25, 50, 75, 100$

Answer:

  $5, 15, 30, 35, 45, 55, 65, 85, 95$
